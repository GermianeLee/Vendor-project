This project is designed to automate the processing and organization of vendor information.
It extracts vendor-specific data from a single source file, then generates an individual file for each vendor, 
storing them in a structured folder system for easy access. The program also integrates with a predefined template, 
automatically populating the relevant vendor details into the template format. This approach streamlines document generation, 
ensures consistency in presentation, and significantly reduces manual effort in managing vendor records.
